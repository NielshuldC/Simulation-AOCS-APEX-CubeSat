3 applications of AOCS on the Hardware-Software testing facility connected to the orbit simulator: orbital data display, Hohmann orbit transfer and Orbit control. The files with SIM are the files running on the laptop for the orbital simulation. The files with sender are files uploaded to the microcontroller interfacing the simulation and the CAN bus. The receiver file is uploaded to the microcontroller communication via the CAN bus.
